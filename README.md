This DokuWiki-plugin was originally created to include an approved html-form into a wiki-page. But it can also be used to insert safely php into DokuWiki-pages.

Please notice that this plugin is a fork of the incl_form-plugin, which can be found at [https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:incl_form]. The documentation of the new plugin is available at [https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:inclform].

The original author is Kite, kite@puzzlers.org
